# Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine of Idealization
This is the Github repo for Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine of Idealization 

## Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine
[Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine](https://gwern.net/doc/borges/1937-borges-raymondllullsthinkingmachine.pdf) was invented at the end of the thirteenth century as an instrument of philosophical investigation with multiple rotatable discs of concepts to generate logical combinations as an answer to theological questions.

In this project, we aim to create vibe research paper titles in a Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine way, i.e., change the "A" in the figure to "LLM". The generated paper titles and outlines can potentially serve as a baseline for [automated idea generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04109) and [AI research outcome prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00794).

## The Holy Discs:
At the current stage of the project, we identify three discs of concepts:

Theme (A): some themes of research direction, e.g., few-shot.

Domain (B): some domains of tasks people work on, e.g., argument mining.

Architecture (C)


## Sources of the concept discs

Seed set, crowdsourced from expert researchers, and mined from OpenReview


## Discussion


## Interested?
If you would like to contribute your concept words or there is any suggestion, you are welcome to open an issue or send me an [email](mailto:xinranz3@andrew.cmu.edu), I will respond to that as soon as possible.
